### Each node will contain Data and a pointer to next node

###### Each linked list will have this kind of pattern



###### First/Head is  a pointer pointing to the first node or the head node



## THe continuity is maintained via heap

## Node 

## Data + Pointer to next node(TYPE -->> It is of node type)

#### It is a pointer of its own type
#### Node A1  [Data,Next]

## Size of a node -->> 4 Bytes


## struct Node *p = NULL;

### We will have the following

### First pointer will be pointing to the first node

## It will be same as that of the first

## Same node where the first id POINTING 

###
Traversal
<p>
we will have

struct Node *p =NULL;

while(p!=0)
{
    p = p=>next;
}
