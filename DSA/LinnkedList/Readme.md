##### The problems with arrays



###### Once created , the size of an array remains the same

###### If during th erun time the size of the array is not specified , then we can have this

###### The size may be in sufficient or in excess




##### int Arr[n] -->> Only n number of elements can be stored

##### Programmers -> Write programme for teh users

## List or array size-->> The list size will be decided


##### The difference between Array and LL

## Say we have Arr[5] // Created inside the activation record of the main function
## 

## int *p = new int[5];//at run time //An array of size 5 will be created in heap
## The pointer p is at stack

## The size will be created 


## The linked List
### We dont know the fixed size bench
### Let the user give as many elements as it wants

## A variable size data structure is required

## One pointer 5 spaces are provided

## int *p;

## p = new int[5]; p -> head node , head will point to the subsequent nodes

## The lement and pointer space -->> Together called a linked list
