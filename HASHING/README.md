# THE KNOWN SEARCH PROCEDURES
## The time taken for Binary Search is Log n
#### The Search method smaller than log n is required

## Search the keys less than the logn times


### We will have the following 

## Binary search the Keys must be in Sorted Order

### If we are keeping efforts
## To mae them in the sprted order


### The keys are stored in the following order

## Search for any index
## 18 Directly go to index 18


### Thhe fastest searching method is hashinh

##  Must have spaces  


## Chaining 

### The modulus hash function has the disability that more than one key
### Is mapped to the same location


###  Node creationo and then the value is appended onto it

### Rest of the values are inserted after wards
### In a chain wise fashion

### The keys are inserted i the sorted order
 

## Array of linked list
### LL is made up of it

#### Search for the key number 12
### We will have the following

## Search h(x) % 10 <-->The required hash function
## agao to remainder index and insert node on the ascending order


### Suppose we will have 100 keys 
### THEN we will have

## n=100
## n/size <-- Loading FACTOR>


### The  number of elements 

### It is based upon the loading factor

## size/n <-- > Assumptions the keys are uniformly distributed

###### For successfull search the time for search is t = 1


#### Average time -->> Half of the loading factor

## t = 1+loading factor(lambda) /2(Successful search)
## lambda is the loading factor


## Avg time t = 1+ lambda

## Deletion of the key 

### Go to index 2 and delete the nodes in the given postion

## h(x) = x%10
##### We are doing it on the basis of the last digit
##### h(x) = (x/10)%10
### The size of the mod will be llimited
