## Polymorphishm is of two types:

## Static polymorphism

## Dynamic polymorphism

## Polymorphism that gets resolved during compile time is known as static polymorphism or compile time polymorphism. This polymorphism is achieved using overloading of the methods in the same class, called as Method overloading.

## Method overloading allows the programmer to have multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but differing in their signature.

## Signature can differ by

## the number of parameters

## the data type of parameters

## the order of the parameters

## Note: We cannot overload methods by their return type, i.e., two or more methods are not overloaded if they differ only in their return type.
