// JavaScript Numbers


// avaScript numbers are primitive data types and, unlike other programming languages, you don’t need to declare different numeric types like int, float, etc. JavaScript numbers are always stored in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. This format stores numbers in 64 bits:

// 0-51 bits store the value (fraction)
// 52-62 bits store the exponent
// 63rd bit stores the sign
// Numeric Types in JavaScript
// In JavaScript, numbers play an important role, and understanding their behavior is essential for effective programming. Let’s explore the various aspects of numeric types in JavaScript.

// 1. The Only Numeric Type
// As we know JavaScript has only one numeric type: the double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 means that it doesn’t differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers explicitly. Instead, it uses a unified approach for all numeric values.

// Integers and floating-point numbers are both represented using this format.
// The numeric precision is 53 bits, allowing for an accurate representation of integer values ranging from -2^53 + 1 to 2^53 – 1.
