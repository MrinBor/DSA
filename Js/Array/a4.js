/**
 * Methods pop/push, shift/unshift
A queue is one of the most common uses of an array. 
In computer science, this means an ordered collection 
of elements which supports two operations:

push appends an element to the end.
shift get an element from the beginning, 
advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.

 */


// We will have the following
// <-shift(Out from back side) CONTENTS push  <-Push the contents into the stack



/**
 * Arrays support both operations.

In practice we need it very often. For example, 
a queue of messages that need to be shown on-screen.

There’s another use case for arrays – the data structure named stack.

It supports two operations:

push adds an element to the end.
pop takes an element from the end.
So new elements are added or taken always from the “end”.

A stack is usually illustrated as a pack of cards: new cards 
are added to the top or taken from the top:

//Lowercase is greateer than the Uppercase

console.log("\n\nImplementation of the same")
console.log('a'>'Z')




console.log("New Comparisons 2")
console.log( 'Österreich' > 'Zealand' ); // true
