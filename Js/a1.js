/**
 * Depending on whether you have use strict or not, the result may be:

undefined (no strict mode)
An error (strict mode).
Why? Let’s replay what’s happening at line (*):

When a property of str is accessed, a “wrapper object” is created.
In strict mode, writing into it is an error.
Otherwise, the operation with the property is carried on, the object gets the test property, but after that the “wrapper object” disappears, so in the last line str has no trace of the property.
This example clearly shows that primitives are not objects.

They can’t store additional data.

//Everythinh is an object in JS


/**
 * The special primitives null and undefined are exceptions. They have no corresponding “wrapper objects” and provide no methods. In a sense, they are “the most primitive”.

An attempt to access a property of such value would give the error:

/**

 * Now we will haev the following

//THE  Objects  are always truth in values
// We will have the following

/**

 * The str is anprimitive data type

//str is known as the Primitive data type of the string

//Methods of Primitives

/**
 * 
 * The primitive data types in Java Script
 * Primitives -->> Strings and numbers 
 * As if they are Objects
 * 
 * A primitve
 * 
 * Its value is of primmitve type
 * 
 * There are 7 Primitve types they are
 *  string , number , bigint , boolean , symbol , null, undefined
 * 
 * 
 * The data types are as follows 
 * 
 * symbol
 * null
 * undefined
 * 
 * string 
 * number 
 * bigint
 * boolean 
 * Symbol
 * null 
 * undefined

 * String numebr bigint boolaN

// Example ysage og JS

/**
 * So here we’ve made an object john with the method sayHi.

Many built-in objects already exist, such as those that work with dates, errors, HTML elements, etc. They have different properties and methods.

But, these features come with a cost!

Objects are “heavier” than primitives. They require additional resources to support the internal machinery.
