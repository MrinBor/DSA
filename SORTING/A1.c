 * 
 *  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
 * 
 * All the possible pairs are compared within this
 * We will have the following
 * 
 * Results
 * 
 * At each pass the largest element is sorted
 * 
 * No of compariosns -->> 4
 * 
 * No of comparison will be 
 * 
 * In the consecutive ones Only
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * No of comparisons == no of swaps
 * 
 * 
 * 2nd Pass
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * If there are n elememnts then we will do (n-1) comparison
 * 
 * Pass and the compariosn
 * 
 * Swpas and the ocomparisons
 * 
 * 
 * The sorting of the elements
 * 
 * 
 * The sorting algorithms are as follows
 * 
 * n elements
 * n-1 <-- Passes
 * 
 * 
 * n-1 Swaps n(n-1)/2 <-- The no of comparions
 * So thus the complexity of the Bubble sort Algorithm
 * The number of comparison and th e swaps
 * 
 * Comparisons and the swapping of teh elements
 * 
 * The heaviest elements settles at the bottom 
 * Therefore This is referred to as the Bubble Sort Algorithm
 * 
 * 
 * k comparison we will get the k largest elements
 * We will have the following
 * 
 * Performing the selected no of passes to get the desired results
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * O(n^2)
 * Bubble
 * Insertion 
 * Selection
 * 
 * O(nlog(n))
 * Heap 
 * Merge
 * Quick
