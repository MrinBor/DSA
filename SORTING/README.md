##  The osrting techniques


##  Based on the number of comparison
##  No of swaps performed
##  Stability
##  Extra Memory
##  And more to go


##  Notes in HINDI AS well



# INSERTION OSRT ALGORITMS

## INsertion of the element number 12

#### We will have the following 

## Element shift and the insetion of the same

## All the larger element are shifted on the R.H.S 

### Array INSERTION SORT ALGORITHMS


## Take out an element and insert it into a sorted a sorted postion


### Insetion of the element number 4\


# The insertion of the elements


###### Insertin of the elements 
### insertion  
## The number of comparisons
## We will have the following
## NNo of passes -->>(n-1)
## NO OF COMPARISONS -->>n(n-1)/2
## The polynomial is of degree n^2
